The RespTech Project's Licenses
===============================

Description
-----------

This repository holds licenses created by The RespTech Project, a sub-team of
[42tm][42tm]. Each license is available in various file types, but if you want
to copy and include the whole license text along with your project, you should
pick the plain text format. Other formats are just there primarily for reading
only, and the contents in other formats are slightly modified.
