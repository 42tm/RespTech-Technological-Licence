The RespTech Wallpaper Public License is a public copyright license that is
intended for wallpapers (i.e. images that are intended for everyone in the
public to set as wallpaper). The license tends to make sure that both sides -
the author(s) and the users - benefit from the artwork. Everyone is allowed to
use the wallpaper on any device, modify the wallpaper under the condition that
the modified one must be kept secret for private use or licensed under a public
license, and redistribute the exact copies of the wallpaper, as long as the
authors' names and a link to a copy of the RespTech Wallpaper Public License is
explicitly provided.
